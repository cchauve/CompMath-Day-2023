# Processing the E faecalis and E faecium samples with HyAsP, using the HyAsP NCBI database.

Slurm commands to run HyAsP:
sbatch run_HyAsP_E_faecalis.sh
sbatch run_HyAsP_E_faecium.sh

In terms of writing, there is q lot of duplication between these two scripts
and a better approach would be to have a unique template script that can be
parameterized with an input file. 

Once all slurm processes are over, the results are checked and summarized with
./summarize.sh
